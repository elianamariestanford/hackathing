**Pong Tracker**

**Project Description**
We attempted to build a real-time pong table line and availability tracker designed to help users see which tables are open, join a queue for a specific table, and receive updates as availability changes.

**Team Contributions**
Eliana designed the initial system architecture, conducted foundational research on full-stack web development, set up the client–server structure, configured Node modules, and built the initial project infrastructure. Shannen implemented several additional features and enhancements, contributing significantly to functionality and overall project depth. AI tools were used extensively for feature development, testing, debugging, UI improvements, and iterative enhancement. While AI accelerated implementation and helped resolve technical issues, the core architectural decisions, learning process, and system understanding were driven by our own design goals and experimentation. We worked closely together throughout the project, iterating continuously and integrating features as we learned.

**What We Learned**
Neither of us had extensive experience with full-stack web development prior to this project. Through this build we learned:
1. How frontend and backend systems communicate
2. How to structure a Node.js project and manage dependencies
3. How to run and debug a web application locally
4. The fundamentals of client–server architecture
5. Basic CSS and JavaScript Syntax
6. How to responsibly integrate AI tools into development without losing  understanding

**What Didn’t Work / Challenges**
1. Version compatibility issues between dependencies
2. Relearning Git workflows, especially during collaboration
3. Deciding where AI assistance was helpful versus where it risked becoming over-reliance
4. Debugging unexpected frontend–backend integration problems
